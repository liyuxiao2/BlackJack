Hit: Request an additional card.
Stand: End your turn and let the dealer play.
Double: Double your bet and receive one more card before your turn ends.
The objective is to have a hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over. If you go over 21, you bust and lose the round.
After the player ends their turn, the dealer will automatically play by drawing cards according to the standard Blackjack rules.
The player wins by having a higher total than the dealer without exceeding 21.
Good luck, and have fun!
